# Project 4 - Let's Ride
_Data Analytics BootCamp (updated 14/09/2023) Final Project_

I have been tasked with finding a problem to solve using machine learning.

I have chosen to see if I can determine if it will rain on a certain date based on historical rain data. I will then utilise this data to go and ride the long way home from work.

I have utilised [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to analyse and present my analysis.

I created a data set utilising the rainfall data retained by the Bureua of Meterology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml). In addition I created a csv file containing the data for each of the weather stations.

**Contents:**
- [Rain_Cleansing.ipynb](Rain_Cleansing.ipynb) - File to import and cleanse data
- [Rainfall_ML_Model.ipynb](Rainfall_ML_Model.ipynb) - File to run initial Deep Learning models
- [Rainfall_ML_Model_Hyper.ipynb](Rainfall_ML_Model_Hyper.ipynb) - File to run hyperparameters on Deep learning models
- [SkLearn_MachineLearning.ipynb](SkLearn_MachineLearning.ipynb) - File to run SkLearn models on data

**Presentation**
My presentation covering the background and information found upon running machine learning can be found on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/shared/PB2KTJ4MN?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Attributes**

Code has been sourced from in class activities from at least half the modules covered over the prior six months, along with the websites outlined above for each code utilised, along with the assistance of sites such as stack overflow when errors arose.
